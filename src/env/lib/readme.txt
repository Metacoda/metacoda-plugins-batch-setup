This lib directory for the Metacoda Plug-ins Batch Interface is
used to house the metacoda-plugins.jar file together with all of
the required SAS jar file dependencies.  The SAS jar files are
not shipped with the Metacoda batch interface package but need
to be manually sourced from the customer's SAS software 
installation.
